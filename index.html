        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Maxwell Dunn and I am a UCSD college graduate with a love for programming. I originally majored in Neurosciene and Physiology because I loved problem solving, critcal thinking, and helping others, and because I had a love for the vast unknown. Neuroscience is a field where we know very little and we are always on the precipice of discovery. Fortunately, I found coding because I never knew that it was exactly all of those things! And it is even more engraved in the other thing I love: Creativity! I have always loved to make new things, create new ideas, and forge new skills to add to my arsenal.</p>
        <p>I am dedicated, motivated, and the hardest worker in the room at all times. I was captain of the O-line on my highschool football team, I am a manager at one of the most successful math tutoring centers in the nation, and I graduated from the 18th ranked college in the world, with one of the most diffucult majors you can choose. Hard work and learning are my specialties, and I am confident that I can tackle any challenge I face. However. The best part is if I do fail, I not only pick myself back up, I learn from it and come out even stronger than before. But enough talk, let me show you what I can do.</p>
